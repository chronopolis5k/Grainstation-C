Grainstation-C is an open-source, granular performance workstation designed to build realtime, evolving sound sculptures. It seamlessly integrates with a Novation LaunchControl XL (easily modifiable for any other controller) and can processes 4 disk tracks and 3 live input streams. You can save any state as a snapshot and morph to that snapshot at any point in a performance. It has 6 independent pitch delay lines, 6 switchable low pass and high pass filters, live audio looping and multiple granular processing controls including granular time-stretching, frame animation and granular pitch shifting.

Grainstation-C was originally inspired by the Make Noise System Concrete but shortly took on many unique characteristics of its own. http://www.makenoisemusic.com/synthesizers/system-concrete

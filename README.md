Grainstation-C is a granular audio processing workstation. It has multiple tracks of granular sound file processing and live input sound mangling capabilities.

It has been programmed to respond to a Novation Launch Control XL with the User Templates included in the repository.

Grainstation-C was originally inspired by the Make Noise System Concrete but shortly took on many unique characteristics of its own. http://www.makenoisemusic.com/synthesizers/system-concrete

It can create 8 independent settings snapshots and morph controls (fader 8 on the Launch Control XL) between snapshots.

It has 6 independent pitch delay lines, 6 switchable low pass and high pass filters, live audio looping and multiple granular processing controls including granular timestretching and pitch shifting.
